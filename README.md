# PetrolStationManagApp
The app refers to a forecourt with 9 fuel pumps arranged over 3 lanes (three pumps in each lane). For the purpose of demonstrating the app to the customer, each N number of seconds (where N is random) a vehicle is created and awaits to be fuelled. The fuelling takes place automatically i.e. vehicles waiting in the queue should be periodically assigned to an available pump. To add to realism of the demonstration and to account for drivers’ agitation there is a finite period of time to fuel a waiting vehicle before it leaves the forecourt. That period is set to Z number of seconds (where Z is random). Should the vehicle not be fuelled during that period of time, it will leave the forecourt. Similarly, a vehicle that was fuelled also leaves the forecourt, only this time the amount of fuel dispensed is recorded. A pump cannot service more than one vehicle at a time and the following counters have to be kept: (1) running total of the number of litres dispensed during the app’s lifetime; (2) The amount of money these litres equate to; (3) The 1% commission; (4) the number of vehicles serviced, (5) the number of vehicles that left before they were fuelled and (6) keep a detailed list of each fuelling transaction – [Vehicle type, Number of litres and Pump number].
